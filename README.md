# React ToDo

This project serves as a demonstration of the end-to-end process involved in creating, building, and deploying a React application with a mobile-first design approach. The application is hosted on Firebase, with user data stored in the browser's localStorage. Additionally, it incorporates Google Analytics and employs ReCAPTCHA v3 for security.
